Our study aims to predict the type of crime using a set of realistic crime datasets.
Discover and analyze data, explore the relationship between features and types of
crimes, find the most common crimes in each city, and compare datasets in terms of
the algorithmâ€™s impact on them, the best results, and find the most common crimes in
each of them. There are many problems with our interfaces, including the imbalance
